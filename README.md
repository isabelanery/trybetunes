# TrybeTunes

## About
Small project developed at Front-End Development Module of Trybe's Web Development course. 

The goal was to create an application similar to spotify, with simulated login page (only front-end), where users could search for artists, access their albums, play a sample version of the song, add songs to a favorite list (saved on localStorage) and edit their own profile.

Every page uses or simulates an async request to an API, and since the "loading" was a pre-requisite from Trybe, I used an animated loading component to make it a bit more interesting. Click [here](https://isabelanery.github.io/trybetunes/#/) to check it out!

This project was made using ReacjJS class components with state and props manipulation.

## Tools
- ReactJS
- CSS3

## In works: 
I plan on making a mobile version.
